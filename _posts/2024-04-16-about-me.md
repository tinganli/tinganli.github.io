Specializing in fluvial and hillslope geomorphology, I received my PhD in August 2022 from Simon Fraser University and have since been working as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the same institution. Starting from October 2024, to expand my knowledge in geomorphology, I will move to Caltech to conduct research on alluvial rivers and aeolian dunes. 
My research is motivated by one of the overarching questions in Earth Science: How does Earth’s surface co-evolve with climate and tectonics? Earth’s surface is shaped by interacting physical, chemical, biotic, and human processes that cause and are affected by forcings in the Earth system. This impact-feedback loop occurs over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales ranging from sand transport by turbulence in seconds to mountain building in millions of years. 
To provide more confident, process-oriented predictions of the impact-feedback loop occurring on our planet, I attempt to bridge different scales using a range of methods, including field observation, seismology, remote sensing, laboratory experiment, theoretical models, and numerical landscape simulation. I also conduct interdisciplinary research that connects different processes to study landscape evolution, including fluvial process, hillslope process, interacting processes among landslides, rivers, and salmon migration, and aeolian process.
