## Adjustment of Bedrock Channel Width
Bedrock canyons are among the most spectacular erosional landforms on Earth. The erosional processes that carve canyons dictate the pace of landscape evolution and the coupling between tectonics and climate. Most landscape evolution models assume that channel slope is the primary variable that responds to temporal and spatial variations in climate, tectonics, and lithology. However, channel width can adjust much faster than channel slope. Understanding bedrock channel width adjustment remains a stubbornly difficult problem, making it challenging to incorporate into landscape evolution models. 

To explore controls on bedrock channel width, I develop mechanitsic models for lateral erosion by impacts of bedload and suspended load, simulate bedrock channel evolution to explore the width dynamics, and use field observations in Fraser Canyon, British Columbia and flume experiments to investigate the local variations in cross-sectional morphology and flow dynamics.

## Role of sediment in controlling the feedback among topography, climate and tectonics
Sediment links topography to climate, tectonics, and lithology by governing rates of river incision into bedrock. Sediment, in turn, results from weathering of rock on hillslopes, which depends on local climate, erosion rate, and rock properties. Hence, sediment mediates the interactions between topography and climatic and tectonic forcing in evolving landscapes. However, conventional landscape evolution models do not explicitly account for the role of sediment. Most modeling studies use a stream power model, in which bedrock incision is a function of discharge, channel slope and rock erodibility only.

I couple a landscape evolution model with a weathering model to explore the controls on grain size at the landscape scale. Future work involves field work to calibrate the parameters and test the assumptions used in the weathering model; combine the hillslope grain size production model with the grain size fining by abrasion to simulate the downstream grain size in evolving landscape; add models for bedrock erosion by saltating bedload sediment into the landscape evolution modelling framework.

## How likely is it that a future landslide event in the Fraser Canyon will block the river and impede salmon migration?
Landslides occurring near rivers can create river blockages that impede salmon migration. The 1914 Hells Gate Landslide and 2018 Big Bar Landslide were rockslides that temporarily blocked Fraser River, creating overfalls with velocities too fast for upstream fish migration. Larger-scale landslides originating between the canyons also occur and have completely blocked the river including the Texas Creek Landslide (Ryder et al., 1990; Friele et al., 2024; Steelquist et al., this report; that occurred ~2330 Â± 150 years ago). Recognition of the potential risks associated with landslides begged for an investigation identifying the likelihood of a future landslide and what would happen to the landslide debris in the channel.

I use observations of channel morphology and flow obtained during the 2022 Fraser Canyon reconnaissance to answer two inter-related questions: 1) What sediment size can be moved by flows in the Fraser Canyon in the event of a landslide? 2) How long will it take the Fraser Canyon to transport a given volume of sediment?
